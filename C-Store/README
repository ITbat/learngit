Introduction: 
	1.Precondition: the tables to be used should be in the root directory

	2.Run: CD to the folder bin in the terminal, execute ./MyDatabase + orders

	a.Load: input ./MyDatabase load orders, then four binary files will be generated in folder bin, respectively orderkey.bin, custkey.bin, totalprice.bin and shippriority.bin;

  	input ./MyDatabase load tableName(eg: customer, nation, lineitem), then will generate the first column of the table, which named "tableName.bin";

	b.Retrieve: input ./MyDatabase retrieve orders \n, then input primarykey to start to retrieve, input 'Ctrl+D' will exit the retrieve;

	c.Compress: input ./MyDatabase compress orders + number(0,1,2,3), respectively compress the orderkey, custkey, totalprice, shippriority of orders table;

	eg: input ./MyDatabase compress orders 1 to compress the first column(custkey) of orders table, and then three binary files, 'compress_custkey', 'Esorted_custkey.bin' and 'Esorted_orderkey.bin' will be generated. After the end of compress, the compression ratio will be exported. If the number != 1,The system will prompt you to enter a file name after compression;
	
	d.Join: input ./MyDatabase join

	e.Count: input ./MyDatabase count to calculate the number of rows in the orders table.


Note: 1.The type of data is double.
      2.When compressing the third column(shippriority), to execute ./MyDatabase compress orders 3, my system will collapse, but when the other columns are not.
